The site will not work initially because web browsers, such as Google Chrome, block HTTP requests from pages loaded via HTTPS for security reasons. If you want to try the site, please follow these steps:

1-Open Google Chrome.

2-Access the page that is generating the Mixed Content error.

3-Click on the padlock icon in the address bar (top left) to open the page information panel.

4-Click on "Site settings."

5-Scroll down to find the "Insecure content" section.

6-Change the option to "Allow." This will allow Chrome to load HTTP content on the page. 

This is necessary because I didn't want to use the paid plan for the API. After testing, please go back to the settings and change it back to block insecure content again.
